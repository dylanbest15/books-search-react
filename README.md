# books-search-react
This website is a full stack MERN website (MongoDB, Express Server, React.js Client, Node.js) that allows the user to search for books using Google's Books API. The user can then save books to their database and then can view their saved books and delete them when ready. It utilizes axios in order to make back end calls using an Express Router with models and controllers.
